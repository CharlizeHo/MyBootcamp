            Chihiro's family is moving to a new house, but when they stop on the
            way to explore an abandoned village, her parents undergo a
            mysterious transformation and Chihiro is whisked into a world of
            fantastic spirits ruled over by the sorceress Yubaba. Put to work in
            a magical bathhouse for spirits and demons, Chihiro must use all her
            wits to survive in this strange new place, find a way to free her
            parents and return to the normal world. Overflowing with imaginative
            creatures and thrilling storytelling, Spirited Away became a
            worldwide smash hit, and is one of the most critically-acclaimed
            films of all time.
